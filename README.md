My Personal Website
============
Here you can find a brief description about myself and what I do.
You can start your own personal website using this Angular project.
Also I have an Angular template for a starting point [here](https://github.com/diprefranco/angular-template-my-website).
Feel free to use the one you prefer.

## Demo
https://diprefranco.github.io/

## Site
The site shows a header followed by the main section (hero section) to catch users attention.
Here you can access quickly to my resume and see ways of contact me.

After that, we have:
- Experience section: timeline showing briefily my work experience.
- Projects section: cards to see all my personal projects.
- About me section: small paragraph saying a little more about myself.
- Contact section: different ways of contact me.

At the end, we have the footer showing the site icon, links and the contact svg icons.<br />
All the site is **responsive** (it adjusts to different screen sizes).

## Usage
After you clone this repo to your local machine, go to its root directory and run `npm install` to install its dependencies.
Once the dependencies are installed, you can run `npm start` to start the application.

## Versions
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.1.2.
