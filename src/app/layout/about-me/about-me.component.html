    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      I love meeting new people, exploring different cultures, and discovering new places. Last year, I spent a year
      traveling. I worked through the process of getting my Italian citizenship, traveled across Spain, and volunteered
      at a hostel in MÃ¡laga. There, I met people from all over the world, practiced languages, and exchanged cultures
      (like teaching how to drink mate like Messi).

    <h3>What I Like to Do</h3>
    <p>
      If I had to explain it in code:
    </p>
    <p>
      let hobbies = ['Running', 'Hiking', 'Kayaking', 'Music', 'Films', 'Reading', 'Languages'];
